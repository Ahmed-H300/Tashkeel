1.Arabic Text Diacritization Using Deep Neural:
	The goal of this work is to show the superiority of the neural approach compared with other approaches.
	The neural approach we consider is Shakkala of Barqawi and Zerrouki [18]. The reason for selecting this system is because the
	Shakkala **code and the resources used to build it are publicly available
-Survery on approcheas has alot of tools and papers and links
- Tashkeela Corpus Issues
- Cleaning Data--> Cleaned data set and all the cleanning process https://github.com/AliOsm/arabic-text-diacritization
- Metric: Diacritic Error Rate (DER) -W Word Error Rate (WER)  vip in page 6 sth related to Metric in Tables V and VI.


Results:Mishkal and Harakat are the best systems among the non-neural ones, but their performance in not comparable to Shakkala. 
Another advantage of Shakkala is its remarkable ability to handle the difficult case of diacritizing the last letter of each word.



Referred Models:
MADAMIRA analyzer [9]
Elshafei et al. [17]

Belinkov and Glass [5] -->This approach is open-sourced and its results rival
those of the state-of-the-art systems

MaxEnt approach of Zitouni and Sarikaya [8].
Abandah et al.[4] --> error correction and preporcesing technques for data set

Shakkala was built by Barqawi and Zerrouki [18] --most importantly, the open-source project
	Web UI --> https://ahmadai.com/shakkala/
	Code --> https://github.com/Barqawiz/Shakkala

	It has three different trained models.
	The first (and earliest) version is used in the website,
	while the third (and latest) version provides the best 
	results but is limited to 315 characters at a time
